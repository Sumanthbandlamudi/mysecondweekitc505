  <center><b><h1> Injury-experienced satellite cells retain long-term enhanced regenerative capacity </b></h1></center>
<h3><b> Abstract </h3></b>
<p> Background Infammatory memory or trained immunity is a recently described process in immune and nonimmune tissue resident cells, whereby previous exposure to infammation mediators leads to a faster and stronger responses upon secondary challenge. Whether previous muscle injury is associated with altered responses to subse‑quent injury by satellite cells (SCs), the muscle stem cells, is not known.
Methods We used a mouse model of repeated muscle injury, in which intramuscular cardiotoxin (CTX) injections were administered 50 days apart in order to allow for full recovery of the injured muscle before the second injury. The efect of prior injury on the phenotype, proliferation and regenerative potential of satellite cells following a second injury was examined in vitro and in vivo by immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and histological analysis. Results We show that SCs isolated from muscle at 50 days post-injury (injury-experienced SCs (ieSCs)) enter the cell cycle faster and form bigger myotubes when cultured in vitro, compared to control SCs isolated from uninjured contralateral muscle. Injury-experienced SCs were characterized by the activation of the mTORC 1 signaling pathway, suggesting they are poised to activate sooner following a second injury. Consequently, upon second injury, SCs accumulate in greater numbers in muscle at 3 and 10 days after injury. These changes in SC phenotype and behavior were associated with accelerated muscle regeneration, as evidenced by an earlier appearance of bigger fbers and increased number of myonuclei per fber at day 10 after the second injury. </p>

<h3><b> Introduction </h3></b>
<p> Te response of skeletal muscle to acute injury is a highly coordinated process involving recruited and resident immune cells, which together with non-immune muscle cells orchestrate the process of regeneration [1,2]. Following acute muscle injury, satellite cells (SCs), the muscle stem cells, become activated, proliferate and diferentiate into myoblasts, which fuse to form new myofbers [3–5]. Tis process is facilitated and fne-tuned by pro-infammatory and pro-regenerative cytokines released by recruited innate immune cells, as well as resident non-immune muscle cells such as fbroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs) [6–10]. One of the most widely studied models of acute muscle injury involves an intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin (CTX), which leads to clearly defned stages of muscle repair. Neutrophils and infammatory monocytes are recruited within the frst 24  h after CTX injury and are critical for the clearance of dead cells, and the production of infammatory cytokines is necessary to kick-start and maintain the SC proliferation phase [6, 11]. Te infammatory response reaches a peak by day 3 after injury and is followed by a gradual onset of the pro-regenerative phase when pro-infammatory cytokines (IL-1ß,TNF-α) are supplanted by pro-regenerative cytokines(IL-10, IL-6), leading to a switch of pro-infammatory F4/80+Ly6Chi macrophages into proregenerative F4/80+Ly6Clo macrophages by day 10 after CTX injury. Te switch to anti-infammatory cytokines stimulates myoblast fusion into myofbers supporting new muscle growth. Typically, by day 30 after CTX injection the injured muscle is fully repaired [1, 11–13]. Although the events that shape the SC response to injury have been extensively studied, the enduring efects on SC behavior post-injury are not clear. Recent studies have described a novel process,termed trained immunity or infammatory memory, whereby exposure to infammatory mediators leads to epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells [14–16]. Cytokines (IL-1β, GM-CSF and IFN-γ) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), typically released from infamed tissues, have all been shown
to induce infammatory adaptation in some cell types, leading to enhanced responses following subsequent insults [17–21]. Tis process has also been described
in non-immune tissue resident cells, including epithelial stem cells [14–16, 19–23]. Whether previous muscle injury alters SC responses to subsequent injury is not known. Here, we addressed this question using a mouse model of repeated CTX injury and show that prior injury has enduring efects on SC behavior, resulting in accelerated muscle regeneration upon secondary challenge. Materials and methods Mice C57BL/10ScSn mice were purchased from the Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Only male mice were used. Te mice were housed in the Histology Department-accredited animal facility at the University
of Sapienza. Te minimum number of mice per experiment necessary to obtain statistically signifcant data was determined using power calculations. Mice were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups. All the procedures were approved by the Italian Ministry for Health and were conducted according to the EU regulations and the Italian Law on Animal Research. Cardiotoxin injury To induce acute muscle injury, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were injected with, respectively, 0.01  ml or 0.02  ml of cardiotoxin from Naja Pallida (10 µM in H2O, Latoxan ZA Les Auréats, France), using a 30-gauge micro-syringe, as previously described [10, 13, 24]. For tibialis anterior, 0.01 ml of cardiotoxin was delivered in a single injection, while for gastrocnemius the 0.02 ml of cardiotoxin was administered as two 0.01 ml injections.
Freeze injury To perform freeze injury, mice were anesthetized with zoletil (Virbac Laboratories) (50:50 mg/ml) and rompum (Bayer) (20 mg/ml), and placed on a warm pad, and tibialis anterior was exposed by surgical incision of the skin. A sterile metal probe, pre-cooled with dry ice, was gently pressed on the muscle for 10 s. Te incision was then closed using surgical glue. Tissue processing and cell isolation for FACS Muscle single-cell suspensions were obtained as previously described [13, 24]. Briefy, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and perfused with PBS, and the hind limb musculature (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius) was excised, weighed, cut into 1-mm pieces and digested with 1 mg/ml Collagenase type 4 (Worthington) for 1.5 h in a pre-warmed (37 °C) water bath with agitation. Muscles from each mouse were processed individually. Te digested muscle preparation was frst passed through a 70  μm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and then through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed in Dulbecco’s modifed eagle’s medium (DMEM)/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) andresuspended in FACS bufer (PBS 1%FBS). </p>

<h3><b> Histological analysis </h3></b>
<p> Histological analysis was performed on frozen muscle sections as previously described [13]. Tibialis anterior muscles were embedded in tissue freezing medium (Leica) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Frozen muscles were cut into 8 μm sections and stored at−20 °C until use. For morphological assessment, frozen sections were stained with H&E. </p>

<h3><b> Immunohistochemistry analysis </h3></b>
<p> Immunofuorescence analysis was performed as described previously [10]. For immunofuorescence staining of muscle, cryosections were fxed in 4% PFA
for 10  min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized in cold methanol for 6 min at−20 °C, followed by antigen retrieval in citric acid (0.01 M, pH 6), for 10 min at 90 °C. Sections were then blocked in BSA (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, Missouri, USA) 4%, goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, Missouri, USA) 5% for 30 min RT, followed by incubation with the relevant antibodies diluted in bovine serum albumin (BSA) 4% over night at 4 °C: mouse antiPax7 antibody, (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, Iowa), rabbit anti-laminin (1:400 SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), rabbit anti-ki-67
(1:300, Cell Signaling, Denver, Massachusetts, USA) or rabbit anti-ps6 (1:100, Cell Signaling, Denver, Massachusetts, USA). Te next day, sections were incubated with biotin anti-mouse (1:1000 Biolegend, San Diego, California) 1 h RT. Te sections were then washed three times with PBS for 15  min and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies Streptavidin-Cy3 (1:500 Biolegend) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000 Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). </p>


<h3><b> Satellite cells isolation for cell culture </h3></b>
<p> Briefy, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected with scissors and fnely diced with a scalpel into 1-mm pieces. For enzymatic digestion, muscles were incubated with Collagenase type II (Sigma-Aldrich)
0.4 mg/ml in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich), for 45 min in a shaking water bath at 37◦
C. A second digestion was performed in 1  mg/mL of Collagen/Dispase (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) in PBS calcium–magnesium-free (SigmaAldrich), for 30  min at 37◦C. Te digested muscle was
then passed through 70 μm cell strainer frst and 40 μm
cell strainer then to remove debris [25]. Next, satellite
cell purifcation was performed by using SC Isolation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). </p>


<h3><b> FACS‑sorting of satellite cells </h3></b>
<p> Quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles of mice were
subjected to enzymatic dissociation (in PBS with 2  mg/
mL Collagenase A (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 2.4
units/mL Dispase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 10  ng/
mL DNase (MilliporeSigma), 0.4  mM CaCl2 and 5  mM
MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. Te cell suspension was fltered through a 40 μm nylon flter and incubated with the
following antibodies for 30 min: CD45 (1:50, Invitrogen,
USA), CD31 (1:50, Invitrogen, USA), TER119 (1:50, Invitrogen, USA), Sca1 (1:50, Invitrogen, USA), Itga7 (1:500,
AbLab, USA). Satellite cells were identifed as
TER119−CD45−CD31−Itga7+Sca1− cells.
Cell sorting was performed with MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter). </p>

<h3><b> Satellite cell culture </h3></b>
<p> Cells were then counted, washed and resuspended in
growth medium (GM) containing DMEM 20% horse
serum (HS) and 3% chicken embryo extract (CEE), and
plated. An aliquot of the satellite cells was cyto-spined
onto a microscopy glass for immunofuorescence analysis
of the cells before culture. After 3  days in culture, cells
were switched to diferentiation medium (DM) containing DMEM 5% HS, 1% CEE. </p>

<h3><b> Real‑time quantitative PCR </h3></b>

cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).
PCR amplifcation was performed using the SensiMix™
SYBR® Low-ROX Kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Data analysis was performed 7500 Software v2.0.6

<h3><b> Single‑cell reanalysis </h3></b>
<p> Original data from Oprescu et al. [26] were downloaded
from GEO repository (accession number GSE138826).
RNA counts and metadata (including original cell annotation) were imported from the regendata.rds fle containing the merged dataset with all cells from all time points.
Data were processed and normalized as previously
described in the original paper with minor modifcations (SCTransform v2 function) [27]. Te top 30 principal
components were used for UMAP embedding. </p>

<h3><b> Statistical analysis </h3></b>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6. Data are presented as
mean±SEM. Statistical signifcance was determined
using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test with Welch’s
correction for unequal variances. A P value of<0.05 was
considered statistically signifcant. </p>

<h3><b> Results </h3></b>
<p> To explore the possibility that infammatory adaptation,
a process which has been described in various cell types
[14, 19, 28, 29], might also be a feature of skeletal muscle
satellite cells (SCs), we injured the gastrocnemius (GA)
and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of WT mice with CTX
injection, and 50  days after the CTX injury (50 DPI),
when the muscle is fully recovered (Additional fle  1:
Fig. S1A–C), we isolated the SCs (from now on referred
to as injury-experienced SCs, ieSCs) to examine their
rate of proliferation and ability to form myotubes ex vivo
(Fig.  1A). Neither ieSCs, nor control SCs isolated from
uninjured muscle (from the uninjured contralateral leg),
were positive for the proliferation marker ki67 at the time
of isolation (T0), and there was no diference in their
number or size (Additional fle  2: Fig. S2A–C). On the
other hand, when cultured in vitro, a signifcantly higher
percentage of ieSCs were positive for Ki67 at 24 and
48  h after plating, compared to control SCs, suggesting
that ieSCs enter the cell cycle faster than injury inexperienced control SCs (Fig. 1B–C). Moreover, after 4 days
in culture, ieSCs formed bigger myotubes with increased
number of nuclei compared to control SCs, suggesting
that they fuse at a signifcantly higher rate (Fig.  1D–F).
Tese results show that previous injury has a lasting
efect on SC behavior that is independent from the muscle microenvironment. </p>

<h3><b> Conclusion </h3></b>
<p> In this study, we show that skeletal muscle injury has a
long-lasting efect on the muscle stem cells, the SCs, such
that ieSCs demonstrate enhanced regenerative properties
upon subsequent injury resulting in accelerated regeneration. Future studies are needed to understand the longterm health ramifcations of this process and uncover
novel potential avenues to explore in order to harness its
benefcial efects to ameliorate muscle regeneration in
muscle diseases. </p>
